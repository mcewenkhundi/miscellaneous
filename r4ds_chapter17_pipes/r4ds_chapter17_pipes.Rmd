## 1. Backgound

<br>

## 2. Set-up

Load all required packages for analysis.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)    #for data manipulation
library(knitr)        #for tables

```

## 3. Chapter 17 introduction

![](data_science_concept.png)

-   Writing code is similar in many ways to writing prose. Rewriting is the key to clarity.

-   The first expression of your ideas is unlikely to be particularly clear.

-   You can save a lot of time later trying to recreate what your code did.

    -   Reproducibilitycrisis in science

-   This doesn't mean you should rewrite every function

### Next chapters in this section

-   In pipes chapter18, you will dive deep into the pipe, %\>%, and learn more about how it work

-    In functions chapter19, you'll learn how to write functions which let you extract out repeated code so that it can be easily reused.

-   chapter20, R's data structures, provided by vectors

-    Chapter21 Tools for iteration that let you do similar things again and again.

```{r import}



```

## 4. Chapter 18 Pipes

-   The pipe, [`%>%`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html), comes from the **magrittr**

-   Packages in the tidyverse load [`%>%`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html) for you automatically, so you don't usually load magrittr explicitly

### 5.  Task explore alternative ways of using R using (calling) R 

-   (Penguins dataset) Includes measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex. This is a subset of penguins_raw.

-   Using the [`penguins`](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) dataset, calculate the average body mass for Adelie penguins on different islands.

    ![](lter_penguins.png)

```{r tidy}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

#Find out more about penguins by typing ?penguins
View(penguins)

#Saving original copy
penguins_o <- penguins

```

### 6 Conceptual framework  (solving the problem)

-   Filter `penguins` to only keep observations where the species is "Adelie"

-   Group the filtered `penguins` data frame by island

-   Summarize the grouped and filtered `penguins` data frame by calculating the average body mas

-   **But how do we implement this in code?**

### 7  By saving intermediate steps

**Why is this problematic?**

```{r}
penguins_1 <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins_2 <- group_by(penguins_1, island)
penguins_3 <- summarize(penguins_2, body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
penguins_3
```

### 8  By overwriting the original

Similar to above

```{r}
penguins <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins <- group_by(penguins, island)
penguins <- summarize(penguins, body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
penguins
```

### 9 Function composition

```{r}
summarize(
  group_by(
    filter(
      penguins_o,
      species == "Adelie"
    ),
    island
  ),
  body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
)

#Same as 
summarize(group_by(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), island), body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### 10 Pipes approach

**focuses on verbs, not nouns**

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

```

## X. Reproducibility

This reproduction of the analysis was run by:

```{r sysinfo, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA, warning=FALSE}

sysinfo <- Sys.info()

sysinfo <- data.frame(keyName=names(sysinfo), value=sysinfo, row.names=NULL)

sysinfo %>% kable()
```

Analysis was run at **`r Sys.time()`**, and using the following Session Info:

```{r sessioninfo, echo=FALSE, results='markdown', message=FALSE, comment=NA, warning=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
